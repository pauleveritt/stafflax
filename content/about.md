Lacrosse is the fastest growing sport in the country, and
[Stafford Lacrosse Association](http://staffordyouthlacrosse.com) (SLA)
is a local non-profit that helps to grow lacrosse in the Stafford area.
SLA is part of Northern Virginia Youth Lacrosse League (NVYLL), the
largest lacrosse rec league in the country.

A number of years ago, SLA worked to get girls lacrosse into high
schools. The 3-3-3 project is our latest initiative.

## 3 Goals

- Ensure we field 2 full girls teams at each age level in 2018

- Increase the number of players feeding into certain high schools

- Bring lacrosse opportunities to a broader cross-section of players

## 3 Activities

- Send our "collegians" to P.E. classes

- Followed by a 1-day after-school clinic

- Followed by a low-cost summer camp

## 3 Years

- Start with a pilot year

- Followed by increasing school coverage each year

- In Year 3, produce over 15 new players per grade

## What's Unique?

- Rather than rely on volunteers, we are paying our "collegians":
  county women who played SLA and now play in college

- Choosing the schools lets us target both under-served high
  schools and under-served demographics

- This plan pays for itself through the camp, rather than asking
  spring league registrations to pay
