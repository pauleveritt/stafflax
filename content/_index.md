[Stafford Lacrosse Association](http://staffordyouthlacrosse.com) (SLA)
is a local non-profit aimed at growing lacrosse in the area. We've
embarked on an ambitious project called *3-3-3*. In this first pilot year,
we are going to P.E. classes in a handful of schools, followed by a
free one-day after school program.

For now, most information is available through our
[@stafflax](https://twitter.com/stafflax) account on
Twitter. If you'd like to reach the 3-3-3 team, head over
to [the contact page](/contact) for details.
